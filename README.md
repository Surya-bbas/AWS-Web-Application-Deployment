# AWS-Web-Application

This project demonstrates the deployment of a website on AWS Amplify, utilizing AWS Lambda Function and API Gateway to calculate the sum of two numbers and store the answer in DynamoDB.

# Overview
The project consists of the following components:

**Frontend Website:** Deployed on AWS Amplify, the frontend provides a user interface for inputting two numbers and submitting them for calculation.

**Lambda Function:** A serverless function written in Node.js, hosted on AWS Lambda, handles the calculation of the sum of the two numbers.

**API Gateway:** AWS API Gateway is used to create a RESTful API endpoint that triggers the Lambda function.

**DynamoDB:** The result of the calculation is stored in DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS.
